Pi Island is a native macOS application that provides a dynamic island interface for interacting with the [Pi coding agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono). It lives in the notch area of your MacBook and provides:

- Real-time session monitoring with visual activity indicators
- Multi-session management with instant switching
- Markdown rendering with syntax-highlighted code blocks
- Dynamic updates when using Pi from the terminal

## Quick Start

1. Download the latest release from GitHub
2. Move `Pi Island.app` to `/Applications/`
3. Launch the app - it will appear in your notch area
4. Hover over the notch to expand, click to open

## Features

### Dynamic Island Interface

Pi Island uses the MacBook's notch area as its home. The interface:

- **Closed state**: Sits invisibly in the notch
- **Hint state**: Pulses when there's activity in a session
- **Open state**: Expands to show sessions list or chat view
- **Bounce animation**: Pi logo bounces when a response is ready

### Session Management

- View all Pi sessions across projects
- Resume any historical session instantly
- See real-time activity indicators:
  - Green dot: Active session with live RPC connection
  - Yellow dot: Recent external activity (terminal Pi)
  - Blue dot: Pi is thinking (waiting for response)

### Chat Interface

- Full markdown rendering with MarkdownUI
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Collapsible thinking messages
- Model selector dropdown
- Real-time streaming responses
