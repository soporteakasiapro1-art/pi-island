Pi Island supports slash commands for quick control of your Pi session.

## Available Commands

### /help

Show the list of available commands.

```
/help
```

### /model

Control the active model:

```
/model           # Cycle to next available model
/model claude    # Switch to model containing "claude"
/model gpt-4     # Switch to model containing "gpt-4"
```

Model matching is case-insensitive and matches against both model ID and display name.

### /thinking

Control thinking/reasoning level:

```
/thinking        # Cycle to next level
/thinking off    # Disable thinking
/thinking medium # Set to medium
/thinking high   # Set to high
```

Available levels: `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`

### /compact

Compact the conversation context to reduce token usage:

```
/compact
```

This is useful when you're approaching token limits and want to continue the conversation.

## Command Aliases

Some commands have short aliases:

| Full Command | Alias |
|--------------|-------|
| `/help` | `/h`, `/?` |
| `/model` | `/m` |
| `/thinking` | `/t` |
| `/compact` | `/c` |

## How Commands Work

1. You type a command starting with `/`
2. The command is parsed locally (not sent to Pi)
3. The appropriate RPC command is sent to the Pi process
4. Results are displayed as a system message

Regular text (not starting with `/`) is sent directly to Pi as a prompt.
