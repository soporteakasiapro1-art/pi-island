Pi Island supports slash commands with autocompletion.

## Using Commands

1. Type `/` to see available commands
2. Use **arrow keys** to navigate the dropdown
3. Press **Tab** or **Enter** to select a command
4. Press **Escape** to dismiss the dropdown

## Built-in Commands

Common commands include:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/model` | Cycle or switch models |
| `/thinking` | Control thinking/reasoning level |
| `/compact` | Compact context to reduce tokens |

## Extension Commands

Pi extensions can register their own slash commands. For example:

```
/synthetic:quotas    # Check API quotas (synthetic extension)
```

All extension commands appear in the completion dropdown automatically.

## How Commands Work

1. Pi Island fetches available commands from Pi via `get_commands` RPC
2. Commands appear in a completion dropdown as you type
3. When you submit, Pi Island sends `execute_command` RPC
4. Output appears as streaming messages in the chat

This means all Pi features work in Pi Island, including extension commands.
