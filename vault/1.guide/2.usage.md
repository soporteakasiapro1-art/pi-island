## Opening Pi Island

Pi Island lives in your notch area. To interact with it:

- **Hover** over the notch for 1 second to auto-expand
- **Click** the notch to expand immediately
- **Click outside** the expanded panel to close

## Sessions List

When expanded, Pi Island shows your sessions list with indicators:

- **Green dot**: Active session with live RPC connection
- **Yellow dot**: Recently modified externally (terminal Pi activity)
- **Blue dot** + animation: Pi is thinking (waiting for response)
- **Cyan dot**: Pi is executing tools

### Session Management

You can manage your sessions directly from the list:

- **Delete**: Click the trash icon on historical sessions to delete them
- Historical session files are permanently removed from disk
- Live sessions cannot be deleted (stop them first)

## Chat View

Click any session to open the chat view with:

- Full markdown rendering
- Syntax-highlighted code blocks
- Collapsible thinking messages
- Model selector in header
- Slash commands for quick actions

## Slash Commands

Type commands starting with `/` to control Pi. All commands are sent to and processed by the Pi agent:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show all available commands |
| `/model` | Cycle or switch models |
| `/thinking` | Control thinking/reasoning level |
| `/compact` | Compact context to reduce token usage |

Extensions can add their own commands (e.g., `/synthetic:quotas`). Type `/help` to see all available commands in your session.

## External Display Support

Pi Island automatically handles external monitors:

- When your laptop lid is closed with an external monitor connected, the notch moves to the external display
- When you reopen the laptop lid, the notch returns to the built-in display
- Display configuration changes are detected automatically

## Tips

### Working with Terminal Pi

Pi Island automatically detects terminal Pi activity:

1. Start a Pi session in your terminal
2. Pi Island shows the session with activity indicators
3. When Pi responds, the notch pulses
4. Click to view the conversation
