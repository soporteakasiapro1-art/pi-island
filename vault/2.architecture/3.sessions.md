Pi Island provides multi-session support across all projects.

## Session Discovery

Sessions are discovered from `~/.pi/agent/sessions/`:

```
~/.pi/agent/sessions/
├── --Users-project-a/
│   └── 2026-01-15T10-30-00_uuid.jsonl
└── --Users-project-b/
    └── 2026-01-25T09-00-00_uuid.jsonl
```

## Session Types

- **Historical**: Read from JSONL files
- **Live**: Active RPC connection

## Resume Flow

1. Display messages from JSONL immediately
2. Start RPC connection in background
3. Show green dot when connected

## Session Deletion

Sessions can be deleted from the UI:

1. **UI**: Trash icon appears on historical sessions in the list
2. **Action**: Clicking trash calls `SessionManager.deleteSession(_:)`
3. **File deletion**: JSONL file is permanently removed from disk
4. **Memory cleanup**: Session removed from `sessions` dictionary and `sessionFileIndex`
5. **Selection update**: If deleted session was selected, selection moves to first live session

**Note**: Live sessions cannot be deleted directly. Stop the session first, then delete the historical record.

## Activity Detection

Pi Island detects session activity without polling:

| State | Detection | Color |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Idle | No recent activity | Gray |
| Thinking | Last message from user + recent file change | Blue |
| Executing | 2+ file changes in 5 seconds | Cyan |
| Externally Active | File modified within 10 seconds | Yellow |
| Error | RPC connection error | Red |
